protoarcane: a little experimental language that transpiles to javascript.

inspired by arabic, protoarcane uses prefixes and suffixes to do programmy stuff.

protoarcane is meant to be spoken, not typed, so special polysyllabic characters are replaced with root modifiers.

all variable names should begin and end with vowels (since the prefixes and suffixes are all consonenty)
